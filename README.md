# The World of Barbie
In honor of the theatrical release of Barbie and our love for data; we decided to engineer a fun yet, informative analysis on Ms. Barbara Millcent Roberts and her world! 
Barbie was created by entrepreneur Ruth Handler and manufactured by American toy company Mattel. Barbie made her debut in 1959. Barbie has evolved over the years and its message to little girls has shifted as well. Historically Barbie has been criticized for many opinionated reasons. However, Mattel has made efforts to address these concerns by promoting diversity, inclusion, empowerment, social values,and representation. 
While we understand the Barbie craze; it is important to note that the impact of Barbie’s message can vary based on individual experiences and cultural context.

# Objective

Analyze careers in both Barbie's world and the real world, aiming to highlight the representation of women across various professional fields. Utilize career Barbies to emphasize sectors that still lack adequate female representation, with the goal of introducing a wider array of professions in the Barbie universe.
Recognizing the significant impact that Barbies have on the developmental years of many young girls, our objective is to shed light on the enduring gender-based wage disparities present in various fields where women and men occupy comparable positions.











# Methodolgy 
After weeks of research we decided it’d be best to webscrape Barbie data from a Barbie archive (https://www.barbiedb.com/). We were able to utilize selenium and bs4 to iterate through a for loop in order to collect all Barbie data from the site.  The  webscrapping was successful and we were able to see images of the dolls in the columns.

Once the Barbie CSV file was clean and we changed some data types using python functions and libraries we saved the new clean data.
We were now able to begin EDA and as EDA took it's course our fascination for Barbie started to grow more in real time. We wanted to explore Barbie's similarities and differences with the real world. 
We found a dataset on Barbie careers and combined it with some career Barbies from the scraped data. 
We've decided to analyze careers in the Barbie World and women's careers in the real world.
